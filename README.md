## Billion Bond is 10x More Decentralized

Open decentralization did not work as intended as more than 70% of mining is in China and the majority of that is run by just a few companies. Billion Bond forces nodes to be in different countries, run by unrelated people/companies.

## Billion Bond is 100x Faster – Gives more transactions per second
Billion Bond will support very high transaction volumes with fast verifications.

## Billion Bond User 1000x Less Energy
The energy used to run the Bitcoin network could power more than 3.5 million US households, 1 million to run Ethereum. We think that’s completely unacceptable and unsustainable. Billion Bond will use a small fraction of the energy used to run other cryptocurrencies.
